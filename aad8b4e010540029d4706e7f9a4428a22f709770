Ideally unresolved comments from previous patches should carry forward to the latest patch, not sure why the carry forward is not happening).\n\nAnyway,\n\n1. I installed SuiteSparse using CMake with LAPACK and BLAS included as shared libraries. But when building Ceres, I get a linker error of the following form: \nLNK2019\tunresolved external symbol dsyrk_ referenced in function \"public: static void __cdecl ceres::internal::BLAS::SymmetricRankKUpdate(int,int,double const *,bool,double,double,double *)\"\nAdded \"SUITESPARSE_INCLUDE_DIR_HINTS\" and \"SUITESPARSE_LIBRARY_DIR_HINTS\" options for Ceres.\nI tried building Ceres as a shared library using the flag \"BUILD_SHARED_LIBS\" as well as static library. Both options give the same linker error mentioned above.\n\n2. The links for CXSparse cmake build point to repos which are at least 8 years old. Should we still provide instructions for CXSparse?\n\nI\u0027ll update the instructions after we resolve this issue.",
