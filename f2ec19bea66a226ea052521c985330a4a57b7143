      "message": "Moved into the `if (MSVC)` block.\n\nI had left it outside the MSVC block since the CMake documentation says CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS applies to all MS-compatible tools which seems to be emphasized by the name (i.e. it\u0027s not CMAKE_MSVC_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS). Seems likely that it will include clang today and potentially others in the future, but until then it\u0027s fine to just keep things simple.",
