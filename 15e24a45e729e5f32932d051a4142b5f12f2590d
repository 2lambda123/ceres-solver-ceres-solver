      "message": "Thanks for the review, Sameer. I uploaded a patch that exposes initialization failures. Some thoughts on user-provided cuSolver handle below. Maybe we could wait to expose that interface for later - the Cuda Dense QR solver will need an additional handle to cuBlas, and the sparse Cuda solver has another handle to cuSolverSP. We could defer adding the functionality of user-managed Cuda handles until we have all three in place.",
