I just understood some issues related to first-estimates Jacobians (linearization_states in the code). Sorry for the confusion! Will push an update soon\n\nEvan",

      "message": "Ok, I pushed a new patch set, and it should be ready to be looked at again. Many of the changes here are related to using the linearization state as the reference point for the marginalization prior. I have also made various improvements to the code and cleaned it up.\n\nSorry I have not used Gerrit in a few years, and I forgot to hit the reply button before, which is why my response was delayed. Also, I believe I rebased to master today, but I see that I have a merge conflict. I can resolve that later.\n\nThanks,\nEvan",
