      "message": "I am not 100% sure that this is the best way.\n\n\n\nIf we keep cell-reordering to keep E and F continuous, and add detection of two possible layouts into cuda-related code instead (with a check if submatrices are layout-compatible with crs [in other words, each contain maximum 1 cell per row-block]), then:\n - We will be able to replace CudaStreamedBuffer invocation with scheduling two asynchronous copies in the case of \"simple\" bundle-adjustment (with a single F-cell per residual). And hope that it will run asynchronously on gpu while we are updating preconditioner on cpu.\n - In other cases we still should be able to permute values of F using just a compressed block structure, without storing permutation; and values of E would be copied as-is.",
