      "message": "This is the version which we re-use the Eigen\u0027s parallel for implementation that takes a cost. I\u0027ve set the cost to a very large number to force sharding and from what I have seen it chooses 4 * num threads as the number of blocks. So the same as Dimitriy\u0027s implementation.\n\nWe should swap out the std function range for Dimitriy\u0027s template solution.",

      "message": "I think it is worth first merging Dmitriy\u0027s ParallelFor changes and then looking at this change in that context, it will be easier to evaluate it both for performance as well what code changes it causes. WDYT? \nDmitriy also has another CL which brings spmv threading, which will also give us some nice benchmarks to evaluate threading rather than just using end to end bundle adjuster solver.",
