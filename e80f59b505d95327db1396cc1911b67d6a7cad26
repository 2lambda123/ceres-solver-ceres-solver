      "message": "Ah, I see. However, if I am reading it correctly, that feature is only exposed by ITERATIVE_SCHUR and CGNR currently. \nAll other linear solvers hard-code it to 1:\nhttps://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/blob/master/internal/ceres/schur_complement_solver.cc#L344\nhttps://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/blob/master/internal/ceres/dense_normal_cholesky_solver.cc#L81\n\nChanging this will require changing the API for how \"non-iterative\" solvers are called, so that they can return a number of iterations, for example, when called like this:\nhttps://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/blob/master/internal/ceres/dense_normal_cholesky_solver.cc#L82\n\nHere\u0027s a potential solution to this: how about if we change the API so that the SolveImpl of all low-level solvers (e.g. DenseCholesky) return a full LinearSolver::Summary object instead of just the LinearSolverTerminationType?",
