      "message": "Updated CUDA partitioned matrix view to follow the same concept as block-sparse view:\n - E submatrix is always copied as-is (it is guaranteed to have CRS-compatible order of values because each row-block has at most one cell)\n - F submatrix is copied as-is if each row-block contains at most one cell or has height of 1\n - Otherwise, permutation from block-sparse to CRS order of values of F is computed on-the-fly while values are being transferred to GPU.",
