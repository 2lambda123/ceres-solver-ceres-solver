      "message": "This is actually out of date, we have removed Ceres\u0027 find modules for Eigen \u0026 gflags as our minimum required versions for them should now be built with CMake so we can use their exported CMake configs instead.  As a result the EIGEN/GFLAGS_INCLUDE/LIBRARY_DIR_HINTS vars will not have any effect, you would need to set Eigen3_DIR and gflags_DIR instead if they were not auto-detected.",
