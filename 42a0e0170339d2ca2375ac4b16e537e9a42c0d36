      "message": "If TripletSparseMatrix is layout-compatible with BlockSparseMatrix (i.e. values are stored in the same order), then no sort is required at all (for both (non-)transposed CompressedRowSparseMatrix).\n\nWe essentially perform a stable sort by the leading dimension, thus, if input values corresponding to each (output) row are already stored in the expected order - we do not need to re-sort any row.\n\n\n\nHere is an example. Let us have the following block-sparse matrix:\n\n```\na b c | 0 0 | g h | 0\nd e f | 0 0 | i j | 0\n------+-----+-----+--\n0 0 0 | k l | 0 0 | o\n0 0 0 | m n | 0 0 | p\n------+-----+-----+--\n0 0 0 | 0 0 | q r | u\n0 0 0 | 0 0 | s t | v\n```\n\nThen values are stored in memory as\n\n```\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuv\n```\n\nAnd values of, let say, 2nd row and 7th column (1-based indices here) are already stored in-order (asterisks above letter denote a values from 2nd row, asterisks below letter denote a values from 7th column)\n\n```\n   ***  **\nabcdefghijklmnopqrstuv\n       * *       * *\n```\n\nFor example, when running this code as a part of SPARSE_SCHUR linear solver, sorting is never called.",
