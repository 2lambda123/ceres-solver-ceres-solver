(worst convergence rate, most often linear?)\nAlso, how well does all this fit into trust-region theory? They seem to use the algorithm exclusively in a global unconstrained way.",

      "message": "Hi Markus,\nActually its Algorithm I which is VP, algorithm III is just alternating minimization.\n\nAs for fitting into the trust region algorithm, you are right the way the algorithm is stated, there is no globalization. So I modified the trust region loop to only try the coordinate descent in the case that the step is successful.\n\nIf I do it on every step, then the trust region sizing breaks down, because it can be that the linear model is a bad predictor, but the coordinate descent improves the convergence, in which case  the trust region gets the credit and things go haywire -- (that was my first implementation). \n\nIf you get a chance, try this on one of your SfM problems, with the cameras as the inner_iteration parameter blocks. setting num_threads \u003e 1 helps tremendously.",
