      "message": "Major change comes from splitting CRS conversion into stucture-related and value-related parts. This allows caching the structure which improves timings even more.\n\nDo you think it would be better to convert BlockSparseMatrix::CreateCompressedRowSparseMatrix into constructor of CompressedRowSparseMatrix?\n\nThis will simplify some code (those who need a pointer will use std::make_unique, those who don\u0027t - will just call a constructor; this will make diff smaller).\nBut this way it will be different from how other conversions are handled (for example, CompressedRowSparseMatrix::FromTripletSparseMatrix is a method returning unique_ptr and not a constructor).",
