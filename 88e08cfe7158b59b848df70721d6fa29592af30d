I think we should separate out ways to check for \"the absolute best possible numerical accuracy\" from unit tests. It is reasonable to expect all tests to pass on all platforms, but I don\u0027t think we can reasonably expect the same numerical performance on all platforms - unfortunately a lot of factors affect the absolute numerical precision.
