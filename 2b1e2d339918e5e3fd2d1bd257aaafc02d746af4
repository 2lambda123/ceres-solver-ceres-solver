      "message": "Hi Sumit,\n\nThanks for taking a stab at this.\n\nLooking through this, I think it would be clearer, and also prevent misalignment later, if we update Ceres\u0027 FindSphinx.cmake s/t it returns FOUND iff all the Sphinx components required by Ceres are found.\n\nThis moves this logic out of the main CMakeLists, and ensures that we can reuse FindSphinx.cmake in docs/CMakeLists and ensure that we are using the same versions (currently *not* the case).\n\n- In FindSphinx, we can lose the block that attempts to find Sphinx for Python \u003c\u003d 2\n- We can move the rtd-theme detection to after the detection of Sphinx in FindSphinx, and search for it only if Sphinx itself is found.\n- We can update find_package_handle_standard_args(Sphinx DEFAULT_MSG SPHINX_EXECUTABLE) to include a variable that clearly denotes the rtd-theme, so something like: SPHINX_RTD_THEME, which would be set only if it is found (the name should be printed in the output on failure automatically)\n- We can update the docs/source/CMakeLists to use find_package(PythonInterp 3 REQUIRED) and then use the resulting executable path instead of `python` in the add_custom_target()\n\nAfter all of this, the main CMakeLists should then look much cleaner, as there won\u0027t be multiple potential failure paths so it can actually be left entirely unmodified, as Sphinx_FOUND will now mean \u0027every part of Sphinx required by Ceres is found\u0027.",
