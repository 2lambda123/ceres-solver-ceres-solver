The current CLIFF entry does that, that does not seem fair.\n\nDo you know of a better convention used by open source software here? where we acknowledge that this is not just the two people who founded the project but it is a team effort?",

For instance, TensorFlow does this: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/CITATION.cff. Alternatively, we could just add `Others` as before and probably leave the `given-names` field empty.",
