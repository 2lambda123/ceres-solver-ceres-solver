      "message": "Hi,\n\nhappy new year.  I\u0027m adding you as reviewer not only to distract you from how this year started, but also because you are both listed in the contributor documentation and on top of the changed file.  This is a trivial change that fixes a small annoyance in miniglog\u0027s interface which is also a deviation from glog (missing const for unused argv parameter).  Please take good care of this patch.\n\nI ran clang-format (which found an unrelated issue in local_parameterization.h) and validated by running the tests on my Mac (100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 165).\n\nBest regards,\n- Tobias Schl√ºter",

      "message": "Thank you.  I am aware of that page and have tried to follow it to a T.  I\u0027m still utterly confused how this page works.  For instance, why is the mouseover text of  \"DRAFT (i)\" the only place that tells me how to actually proceed without any other visual clues?  Also the mouseover text is not correct: there is no \"Reply\" button \"at the top of the change\" (instead it appears to be at the bottom of the box labelled \"Patchset\").  More importantly, I still have no idea how to deduce whether my updated patch flew along the correct trajectory.",
