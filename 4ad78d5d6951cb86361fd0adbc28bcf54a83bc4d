      "message": "I\u0027m sorry this affects so many files.\n\nEssentially I just ran clang-format and then went back to fix some obvious bad formats with clang-format on/off and a few manual cstring breaks.\n\nI\u0027m a bit worried about possible side effects due to changed include orders (ideally it should not matter, but you never know...).\n\nWhereever port.h was specifically mentioned to matter b/c of #ifdefs, I enforced its order to remain unchanged. (I believe in other files the port.h include order should not matter, and in any case it seems clang-format will never reorder includes across preprocessor directives.)\n\nAnother change is setting the standard to \u0027Cpp11\u0027 for clang-format, such that closing template brackets don\u0027t have a space. Hence a few changes in examples.\n\nThere is now also a ./scripts/format_all.sh script.\n\n",
