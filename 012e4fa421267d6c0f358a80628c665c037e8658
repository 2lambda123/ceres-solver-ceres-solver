      "message": "Hi,\n\nThis replaces the threadpool with Eigen. It would be nice if you could run some evaluations on your machines to get a larger test of performance on different machines. I\u0027ve noticed that the timings are fairly noisy.\n\nNote: the CL is complete except for I need to figure out what to do about openmp.\n\nthanks!\nMike",
