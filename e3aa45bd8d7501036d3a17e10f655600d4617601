As a potential user, I really appreciate this functionality and want to add a little comment regarding the API.\n\nIt would be great to have access to the resulting linear sub-system. The reason is: a linear cost function is the standard way to represent the sub-system, but for things like Quaternions it might be better to do this as manifold operation. With access to the resulting sub-system, everyone could choose whether to use the provided linear cost function or to create a custom one.\nMaybe this could be achieved by exposing one of the lower level functions?",
