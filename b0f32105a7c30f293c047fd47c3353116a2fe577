      "message": "Overall this block of text is hard to parse. What about making a table instead? That way it would be much easier to index and get the relevant information for your OS. There can be rows for Windows and OS X that can say \"not relevant\" etc. I\u0027m imagining the following\n\nRows:\nLinux CXX11\u003dON\nLinux CXX11\u003dOFF\nMac OS X\nWindows\n\nColumns:\nClient code must use -cstd11 YES/NO\nComment\n\nWhat\u0027s sort of annoying is that our public interfaces use the shared ptr type (in solver.h) and so whatever choice is used here must also get used by client code.",

      "message": "In this paragraph vs the one after, it\u0027s hard to understand the distinction in the flags without looking really carefully. It may be worth either making a table, or somehow combining them and highlighting what\u0027s different in a single sentence. Perhaps what makes this paragraph harder to understand is that the \"even on C++11 complain versions of GCC \u0026 Clang\" - this makes it seem like both configurations are in C++11 mode.\n\nThink about it; if nothing better comes to mind we can merge this as is.",
