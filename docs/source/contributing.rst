Contributions
=============


We welcome contributions to Ceres, whether they are new features, bug
fixes or tests. The Ceres mailing list [#f1]_ is the best place for
all development related discussions. Please consider joining it. If
you have ideas on how you would like to contribute to Ceres, it is a
good idea to let us know on the mailinglist before you start
development. We may have suggestions that will save effort when trying
to merge your work into the main branch. If you are looking for ideas,
please let us know about your interest and skills and we will be happy
to make a suggestion or three.

We follow Google's C++ Style Guide [#f2]_ and use ``git`` for version
control.
