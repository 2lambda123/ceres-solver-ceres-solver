At Google, Ceres Solver is used to:

* Estimate the pose of `Street View`_ cars, aircrafts, and satellites.
* Build 3D models for `PhotoTours`_.
* Estimate satellite image sensor characteristics.
* Stitch `panoramas`_ on Android and iOS.
* Apply `Lens Blur`_ on Android.
* Solve `bundle adjustment`_ and `SLAM`_ problems in `Project Tango`_.

Outside Google, Ceres Solver is used for solving problems in computer
vision, computer graphics, astronomy and physics. For example, `Willow
Garage`_ uses it to solve `SLAM`_ problems and `Blender`_ uses it for for
planar tracking and bundle adjustment.
