Ceres Solver is an industrial-grade C++ library for modeling and
solving `nonlinear least squares`_ problems. These problems comes up
in a broad range of areas across science and engineering - from
`fitting curves`_ in statistics, to constructing `3D models from
photographs`_ in computer vision.

Ceres Solver features an integrated modeling layer with automatic
differentiation (you can also use numeric and/or analytic
derivatives), well optimized code with extensive tests and state of
the art performance on a variety of problems.

Ceres Solver is used at Google `Street View`_, Google `PhotoTours`_,
Google `PhotoSphere`_, `Project Tango`_, `Blender`_, and more.
