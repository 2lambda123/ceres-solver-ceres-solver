Solving `nonlinear least squares`_ problems comes up in a broad range of areas
across science and engineering - from `fitting curves`_ in statistics, to
constructing `3D models from photographs`_ in computer vision.

What is Ceres Solver?
---------------------
Ceres is an industrial-grade C++ library for modeling and solving large and
small nonlinear least squares problems of the form

.. math:: \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i} \rho_i\left(\left\|f_i\left(x_{i_1}, ... ,x_{i_k}\right)\right\|^2\right).

For a brief introduction to nonlinear solving in general, see the
:ref:`chapter-tutorial`.

Who uses Ceres Solver?
----------------------
There are many users of Ceres, including Google Street View, Google Maps, several SLAM pipelines, Blender, and more. See the :ref:`chapter-introduction` for more users.

Why use Ceres Solver?
---------------------
Ceres is a world-class least squares solver for a variety of reasons, including
an integrated modelling layer, automatic differentiation, optimized code,
extensive tests, and more. See the :ref:`chapter-introduction` for a detailed
list.
