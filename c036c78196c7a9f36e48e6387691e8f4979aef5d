In particular where structs/objects that template over a Jet type say an Eigen::Matrix\u003cJet\u003cT,N\u003e I am getting breakage in existing code were rvalue references are being created and they cannot bind to a lvalue reference that is expected or something like that (my understanding of rvalue references is weak). \n\nUnless there is a simple fix for this, I will have to revert this patch.",
