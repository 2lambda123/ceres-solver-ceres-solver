We already do this conditionally for glog, you will have to update circa line 757 to also now install the relevant modules if using SuiteSparse.\n\nHowever, this is *only* required when building a static version of Ceres, this can be the empty string when BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is enabled as PRIVATE dependencies will not appear in the exported target definition in that case.",
