      "message": "The first part of bringing multi-threading to iterative linear solvers with partitioned matrix view and block-sparse matrices.\n\nThis provides a reasonable speedup for right products.\nWith higher core-counts ratio w.r.t GPGPU approach is close to memory throughput ratio (120GB/s vs 620GB/s in my setup).\n\nNote that a parallel-for implementation with non-interleaving indexes *is a must* to obtain good speedups; with interleaved indexes in ParallelFor performance gains are minuscule.",
