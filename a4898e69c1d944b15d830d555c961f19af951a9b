So I would appreciate you looking at it. \n\nI need to do this before we can move to abseil, since test_utils.cc depends on flags which made testimg dependent on gflags etc.\n\nThe new more modern approach simplifies things enormously. \n\nI suspect my cmake logic is not particularly robust, so I would appreciate feedback there too.",
