      "message": "This is a patch of my last commit. It should be fine. I check the version 3.4.0 and 3.4(with version number macro 3.4.1). Both of them have the same construction of BDCSVD. Only the master branch have changed it. So here I check 3.4.90(the master branch version) and use at_least to make it works with the future version (like 3.5).",

      "message": "3.4.90 is not a real version number, it is a version number that they use in master branch to make sure it is not conflated with the stable release.\n\nMy suggestion is that since there is no stable release of eigen yet with this new constructor syntax, there is no reason to worry about it and add a guard for it. When there is a stable version of eigen we can add this preprocessor guard. \n\nas a result I am going to undo the last commit and unbreak the build.",
