      "message": "I\u0027ll read through this in more detail, but I think it would be very helpful to do the following:\n1. Add documentation to solver.cc to explain the strategy used for checking valid options: how are the options grouped, what order they are checked in, where each dimension of strategy is checked, etc. Then someone adding a new solver could follow the structure of the checking.\n2. We should add tests to check this code.",

      "message": "I thought about documentation and its not clear to me it would be more or less complicated than the code itself. I tried making the function names self contained. could you give me an example of the sort of documentation you are looking for?\n\nright now the idea is that each solver has a function and it is responsible for all the checks that are needed for that solver.\n\nas for tests, the tests would amount to testing policy, but sure I can implement some using Solver::Options::IsValid",
