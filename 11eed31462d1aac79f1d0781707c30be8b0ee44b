These changes depend on this CL: https://ceres-solver-review.googlesource.com/c/ceres-solver/+/20982\n\nTo effectively use Github workflows, I recommend moving the development to Github. This way, successful workflow runs can be used as a precondition for merging PRs minimizing the likelihood of code breakage.",

To simplify the builds, my CMake for SuiteSparse implementation now provides binary packages (currently, 64-bit only) of SuiteSparse for the two latest Visual Studio versions (https://github.com/sergiud/SuiteSparse/releases) that are used here.",
