      "message": "Locally configured full bazel build with `clang-14` and started to enable some compiler checks. First of all enabled `-Wunused-parameter` and commented those parameters which are not used within functions. IMHO it improves readibility a bit since it allows to recognize unused paramters by glance just looking on the top of function.\n\nActually this option is also present in `gcc` so there is no much sense in enabling clang build just for the sake of `-Wunused-parameter` but `clang` provides multiple addional options to check type conversions. I found them especially useful when tried to increase maximum size problem (`int num_nonzeros_ -\u003e std::int64_t num_nonzeros_` in sparse matrices).",
