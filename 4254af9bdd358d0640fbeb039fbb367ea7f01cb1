By only copying the ID, a reference to \u0027other\u0027 is created. \n\nT a \u003d 0;\nT b \u003d a;  // \u003c Here b is now a reference to a but it should be a copy.\n\nTo fix this bug, I will insert a new expression here. This new expression will now be created each time a copy is executed. To reduce the amout of copy expression we pass ExpressionRef by value now.",
