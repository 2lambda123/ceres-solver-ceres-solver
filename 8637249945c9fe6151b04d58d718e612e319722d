      "message": "Hi Morten,\n\nthanks for the quick review.  I would venture to guess that the 20 or so additional cycles for the division vs multiplication are hard to measure next to the calls to both erf(c) and exp, but I have to admit that I wasn\u0027t aware that this is still a fact in the 2020ies.  Thanks for giving me the chance to educate myself.  I\u0027ve changed the code accordingly.\n\nI failed to mention this before, but I made sure that this passes the testsuite, and in particular I made sure that there actually is a test calling erf and erfc before relying on the tests blindly :)\n\nBest regards,\n- Tobi ",
