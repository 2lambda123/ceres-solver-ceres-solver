      "message": "I\u0027m happy to add a comment to clarify that, but it\u0027s something that affects all loss functions, including any the user might define.\n\nFor instance, consider Cauchy and Huber from table 1 in http://www.audentia-gestion.fr/research.microsoft/ZhangIVC-97-01.pdf (p. 24). The implementations in https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/blob/bf1aff2f0eb5733a5dc9a497d5cf67cff25292e5/internal/ceres/loss_function.cc#L77 and https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/blob/master/internal/ceres/loss_function.cc#L53 are also multiplied by 2 wrt the equations in that paper.\n\nI believe the comment you\u0027re requesting is already here: https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/blob/bf1aff2f0eb5733a5dc9a497d5cf67cff25292e5/include/ceres/loss_function.h#L99",

      "message": "I agree there is a comment in [1] that mentions the loss functions are multiplied by 0.5. When I implemented this and the reviewers didn\u0027t remember this and just used the standard Tukey formula.  So it seems like it needs more attention.\n\nSo I think it would be good to mention in the Tukey comments why the equations might appear to not match the form in the papers so future readers aren\u0027t confused.\n\nSomething like:\n\nThe term is computed as follows where the equations are scaled by a factor of 2 because the cost function is given by 1/2 rho(s):\n\n\n\n[1] https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/blob/bf1aff2f0eb5733a5dc9a497d5cf67cff25292e5/include/ceres/loss_function.h#L99",
