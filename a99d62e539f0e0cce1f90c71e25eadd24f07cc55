      "message": "I\u0027m happy to add a comment to clarify that, but it\u0027s something that affects all loss functions, including any the user might define.\n\nFor instance, consider Cauchy and Huber from table 1 in http://www.audentia-gestion.fr/research.microsoft/ZhangIVC-97-01.pdf (p. 24). The implementations in https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/blob/bf1aff2f0eb5733a5dc9a497d5cf67cff25292e5/internal/ceres/loss_function.cc#L77 and https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/blob/master/internal/ceres/loss_function.cc#L53 are also multiplied by 2 wrt the equations in that paper.\n\nI believe the comment you\u0027re requesting is already here: https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/blob/bf1aff2f0eb5733a5dc9a497d5cf67cff25292e5/include/ceres/loss_function.h#L99",
