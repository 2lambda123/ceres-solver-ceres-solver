The compile error won\u0027t (AFAIK) be that much clearer in the event that they pass a Manifold which is *not* copyable or movable, there\u0027s no real SFINAE going on here as we\u0027re not selecting between different implementations based on this, as it\u0027s the only implementation.\n\nIMO, I would remove this, as it\u0027s a compile error either way and I think it would be as clear in either case, and I think the use of rvalue references as args already makes it evident from the declaration.",
