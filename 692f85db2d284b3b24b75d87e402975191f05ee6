      "message": "Looks good, only minor questions.\n\nIn the discussion about linear solvers, it might be useful to point the advanced user to the benchmarks --- exactly which solver is the fastest depends on a lot of details including supported libraries, computer architecture, and exact GPU generation. Short of just trying all options out on the users\u0027 problem, the benchmarks provide a reasonable sense of performance across the many linear solvers, and using several simulated problem types.",

      "message": "On one hand I agree with you, but then I am not sure about what benchmarks to point them to. Between various solvers, platforms and options, the number of benchmarks is rather large and I do not even have the hardware to report them. \n\nWhat I think is worth doing, is some basic performance advice for things to try on your problem. That is something I have been meaning to do for a while now.",
