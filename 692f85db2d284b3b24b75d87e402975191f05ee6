      "message": "Looks good, only minor questions.\n\nIn the discussion about linear solvers, it might be useful to point the advanced user to the benchmarks --- exactly which solver is the fastest depends on a lot of details including supported libraries, computer architecture, and exact GPU generation. Short of just trying all options out on the users\u0027 problem, the benchmarks provide a reasonable sense of performance across the many linear solvers, and using several simulated problem types.",
