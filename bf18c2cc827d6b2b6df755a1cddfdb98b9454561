On one hand it is nice to not accumulate formatting crud, on the other its both time consuming to trigger a formatting check via travis and also weird to break the build because of formatting changes -- especially for small fixes.\nSameer\n",

      "message": "Hi Sameer,\n\nsure, whatever works for your workflow. It was just a fun exercise for me. Feel free to reject of course.\n\nThe job can be marked \"allow_failure\", looks like this: https://travis-ci.org/github/NikolausDemmel/ceres-solver/builds/730948829; I hope it also skips email notifications then, but I didn\u0027t test.\n\nTo ensure formatting, you don\u0027t need to wait for travis. Running clang-format manually on all changed files, or using ./script/format_all.sh before committing should ensure everything is up to date. But I can see how it might still be annoying if that is not generally part of your workflow anyway, or if you have to follow-up after a patch from someone who didn\u0027t run clang-format, just because of a minor formatting thing that wasn\u0027t noticed in review.\n\nBest,\nNikolaus",
