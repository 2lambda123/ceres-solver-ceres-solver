      "message": "Please update the RST documentation as well, since this is one of the more heavily used interfaces.\n\nAs an aside: I realized we could likely pack the ownership into the last bit of the pointer. These autodiff cost functions will be at least 4-byte aligned, and for the most part, 8-byte aligned. It\u0027s maybe worthwhile to avoid the extra bloat. I\u0027m OK to merge the patch without this change though; it can be a followup.\n\nThanks Julien for sticking with this series!",
