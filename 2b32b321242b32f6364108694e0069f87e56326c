      "message": "Tobias I tried various permutations on Travis CI with this change in place, but even extending the wait-time with no output to 20 mins the Linux (GCC) and Android (Clang) builds still failed, they blocked when compiling the schur_eliminator_specializations_set_(X).cc files, see here: https://travis-ci.org/github/alexsmac/ceres-solver/jobs/759312034 for an example.\n\nI\u0027m not sure what exactly is happening here, as the VMs for Linux should have basically the same amount of CPU/RAM capacity as the macOS ones, and they are all passing even with your CL in place.  I did notice that this did result in a noticeable \u0027stall\u0027 in compilation output on my big-core Linux machine, but it did compile.",
