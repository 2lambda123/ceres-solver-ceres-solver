      "message": "Currently, other then being just interested in the field, i am kinda thinking of \"using\" ceres solver to \"find a work\" ðŸ˜Š. Nevertheless, i believe that i will be using ceres solver in my future work, so i think investing some time getting to know the internals might be profitable.\n\nRegarding the ideas for a change, today i spent some time trying get rid of \"...Multiply...AndAccumulate\" at places where no accumulation actually needed (we can save memory/cache bandwidth by not setting the left side to zero and also not fetching values for summation), but i stuck with PartitionedMatrixView multiplication routines updating the same memory locations regardless of what type of multiplications we are actually interested in. Still, this might be interesting to investigate further.\n\nAnother (a bit random, so no proofs about \"how much\" this is an issue will be presented) thought, is to minimize locking contention by upgrading std::unordered_map\u0027s under the mutexes to something faster (i saw abseil is coming?).",

In the cases where this vector is large enough to matter, the actual cost of the left/right multiply is substantial enough to wash it away. This is why I have not spent anytime worrying about it.\n\nyes I would like to start using abseil, sooner rather than later. \n\nI wonder if you would be interesting in working with joydeep to get iterative_schur working on GPUs.",
