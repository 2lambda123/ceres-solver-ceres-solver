I never realized Eigen has an EulerAngles module. I just read its source and found that its euler-to-quaternion is defined in terms of AngleAxis chaining, and euler-to-matrix is a composition of the former and toRotationmatrix(). They should be equivalent to mine but conceivably slower from the extra constructor calls. I\u0027m still studying its matrix-to-euler implementation with some difficulty due to a total lack of comments.",

But templatizing these parameters complicates testing, since tests need to cover all 24 valid combinations of {a0,a1,a2,extrinsic}. If we don\u0027t want to hardcode 24 test steps, then the only alternative is some form of template recursion through the 24 combinations, or possibly using macros. \n\nI also ran a rough benchmark of templatized versus original EulerAngleToRotation on quick-bench.com, and the difference is not substantial. It might be that on high optimization levels the compiler can optimize away the runtime variables and comparions when the user inputs literal integers and bools into {a0,a1,a2,extrinsic}",

      "message": "Certainly, thanks for the concrete suggestions. If we are using explicit names on the public API and calling an impl function, then I\u0027ll drop the {a0,a1,a2,explicit} classification, since you are correct that some combinations of a0,a1,a2 are invalid. \n\nI\u0027ll revert to the convention in Shoemake\u0027s paper, using\n    /* There are 24 possible conventions, designated by:    */\n    /*\t  o EulAxI \u003d axis used initially: [0, 3)\t\t    */\n    /*\t  o EulPar \u003d parity of axis permutation: bool\t\t    */\n    /*\t  o EulRep \u003d repetition of initial axis as last: bool\t    */\n    /*\t  o EulFrm \u003d frame from which axes are taken: bool\t    */\n(see github.com/erich666/GraphicsGems/blob/master/gemsiv/euler_angle/EulerAngles.h) so all combinations of the params are valid. Then on the public API I\u0027ll define forwarding functions that map the 24 combinations of XYZ to the correct template to pass to the impl. \n\nThe remaining issue is how should (Explicit/Intrinsic) be embedded into the public API function names.

      "message": "Hello, I\u0027m back on this contribution project!! Sorry for essentially \"giving up\", but in this year I learned enough about template programming to finally address your comments adequately. I redesigned the implementation around a quasi-tag dispatch approach that lets the user call something like\n\n`EulerAnglesToRotation(some_angle, some_matrix, IntrinsicZYX)` \n\nwhere `IntrinsicZYX` acts as a highly human-readable tag. (whereas the definition of Intrinsic / Extrinsic is still addressed in comments). `IntrinsicZYX` (or any of its bretheren, `ExtrinsicZYZ`, etc. defined in `euler_angles.h`) are struct tags that contains information to specify the behavior of the conversion function. The conversion functions exploit constexpr if to act on these information at compile time. \n\nThis design lets typed tests iterate through a list of these struct tags, achieving the same effect as what I attempted in the past with vanilla for.\n\nI\u0027d really appreciate if you\u0027ll still give this contribution your consideration after so long.",
