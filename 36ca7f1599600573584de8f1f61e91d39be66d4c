      "message": "Only the FindPackages for the dependencies that appear in the public headers, for Ceres are required, as the link libraries are all pulled in via the imported target generated by CMake.  As such, we\u0027re really only using the FindPackage scripts to find the include directories, and we only need those for the libraries that appear in the public (installed) headers.\n\nWe could of course install them all, but they\u0027re not actually necessary.",
