There is some additional math to work with non-unit, constant-norm vectors, but I think its not worth it to add it and over-complicate things (you can always multiply the unit vector by some magnitude outside the manifold). \n\nBecause of that, if we input a non-unit vector that is outside of the manifold then the test would make no sense, and the results would not be conclusive.",
