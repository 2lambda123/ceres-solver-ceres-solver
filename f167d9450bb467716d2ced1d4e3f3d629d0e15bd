      "message": "What about naming it simply as `bazelrc`? I mean that you may be right and naming as `.bazelrc` is not a good idea. And somebody will probably need a custom `.bazelrc`. But at the same time it is also would be a good idea to provide some initial bazel configuration:\n* `bazelrc` which can be looked at when creating custom one (or a user may just simlink it or copy to `.bazelrc`)(\n* `toolchains`. E.g. for `clang` (yesterday I finished a small quest of adapting https://bazel.build/tutorials/ccp-toolchain-config to `ceres`)",
