      "message": "This is exactly as indirect as the test above:\n- it checks that the constructor (which was previously crashing) works (and I suppose that\u0027s the trivial test you would add in local_parameterization_test.cc)\n- it checks that the full pipeline works - other parts of the code may assume that SubsetParameterization keeps *some* parameters constant.\n\nSorry, but I spent alredy too much time on this. This test is valid. My patch fixes a bug in ceres (which was segfaulting, not even throwing an exception). Feel free to add more tests, but this is overkill IMHO.",
