      "message": "Thanks Alexander, this is very interesting. A quick look indicates that much of the issues have to do with size_t to int conversion. won\u0027t you agree? and at most places we should be able to handle it by simply using int64_t instead of int. \nYes technically it is still a narrowing, but I cannot imagine a scenario where this would actually be violated. This is also what the google style guide recommends.\n\nhttps://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html#Integer_Types\n\nso my proposal is fix this problem in a chunk of files at a time, since these code changes can be subtle, reviewing them carefully would be good.",

      "message": "I agree about changing to `int64_t` and `std::size_t` where possible but at some places it cannot be done easily. So in such places it makes sense to use `numeric_cast` at least to highlight these places for the future work. For example we cannot simply change `num_nonzeros` in sparse matrices from `int` to `int64_t` since it affects too many files.\n\nSo, I propose the following workflow:\n* Fix a buch of places where it is enough (and easy) to move to `int64_t`\n* Conver other places which are hard to investigate with `numeric_cast`",
