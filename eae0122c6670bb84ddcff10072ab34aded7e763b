I was wondering if you wanted to take a look at this too. \n\nI think Dmitry has become busy with other things, so I am wondering if you would be interested in taking this CL on and landing it.\n\nUnless Dmitriy you are paying attention and are interested.. \n\nSameer",

I am so glad to hear from you. \n\nI will take a close look to refresh both my memory as well go over the code with a fine toothed comb later today now that we have decided to land this backend.\n\nCan you rebase this on the latest version of Ceres at head.\n\nI am also curious if anything has changed in intel oneapi in the intervening year.",
