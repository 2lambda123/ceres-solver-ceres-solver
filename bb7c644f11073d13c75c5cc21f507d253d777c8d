      "message": "This is a great idea. However, I\u0027m wondering why annotate internal classes only? IMHO, all classes that are not intended to be inherited from should be also marked as `final`.\n\nThis leaves classes that are special instances of an interface, such as `ProductManifold`. While debatable, I think these should also be marked as `final` because it is possible to resort to delegation which should be preferred anyway. Specifically, if one wishes to define a manifold based on `ProductManifold`, it it possible to derive from `Manifold` directly and use a `ProductManifold` member in the implementation.\n\nThe sealing of classes in the public interface would prevent misuse.",
