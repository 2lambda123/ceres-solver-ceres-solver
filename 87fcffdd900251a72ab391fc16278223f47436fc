      "message": "So I am somewhat unclear what the return type in this situation should really be, the cases when it happens are:\n\n1. We can\u0027t find a step_size \u003e minimum which satisfies at least the Armijo condition.\n\n2. The cost function fails to evaluate at a step_size: s, but evaluated successfully at s_l \u0026 s_u s/t: s_l \u003c s \u003c s_u.\n\nThe problem being that the optimal solution satisfies 1), so reporting NUMERICAL_FAILURE seems wrong.",
