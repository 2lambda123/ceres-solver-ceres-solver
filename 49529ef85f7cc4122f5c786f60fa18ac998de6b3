      "message": "document the fact that this assumes certain things about the state and user_state pointers in parameter blocks.\n\nI am still not entirely happy with this. Its fine that we are making sure that on the way out state points to user state, but assuming that is the case on the way in .. that seems a bit iffy still.",
