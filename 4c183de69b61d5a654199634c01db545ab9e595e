      "message": "since the cmake file is fragmented now, up top here it would be useful to document the various variables that the user can define.\n\nThe reason is, unless the user knows the cmake style, it is a pain to guess what the right variable names to set for lapack and blas are.\n\nthe case I am imagining is, the lapack/blas detection fails and it is installed in some random location ...what should the user do? go plumbing in findlapack.cmake?",

      "message": "OK, so as the FindPackage scripts for BLAS \u0026 LAPACK are shipped with CMake (and maintained by Kitware) they should work across standard system installs.\n\nIf the user has gone wild and put things in non-standard locations, then it\u0027s a bit messy, as it depends on what the author of the FindPackage script did as to how much help the user will get (we give a lot - see later in this note).  In the case of BLAS \u0026 LAPACK, they don\u0027t get much, just LAPACK/BLAS_FOUND \u003d FALSE and LAPACK/BLAS_LIBRARIES \u003cempty\u003e or FALSE.\n\nThe variable BLAS/LAPACK_LIBRARIES that we need is covered in the FindLAPACK/BLAS scripts, but would not appear in the CMake GUI (as it\u0027s not a cache variable).\n\nAs it stands, they would have to either:\n\n1) Write their own FindBLAS/LAPACK.cmake scripts installed somewhere in the CMAKE_MODULE_PATH (and thus used in preference to the standard CMake modules).  This is probably the best alternative, as they will likely have the same problem across multiple projects, this way they would centralise the hard-coding of the special case of their installation.\n\n2) Hack our CMakeLists file to not use FIND_PACKAGE(LAPACK) but replace it with:\n\nSET(LAPACK_FOUND TRUE);\nSET(LAPACK_LIBRARIES \u003cmagic installed libraries\u003e)\n\nIn general, 1) is \u0027better\u0027, 2) is perhaps the more likely path for the user who \u0027just wants stuff to work\u0027.\n\nWe might be able to make it a bit nicer for them by upgrading the BLAS/LAPACK variables to cache vars and making them visible if they are not found in our CMakeLists thus allowing the user to specify them in the GUI (in addition to outputting an error message).  But the downside to this is that there is a lot of checking of the validity of the BLAS/LAPACK libraries in FindLAPACK/BLAS that we would not be replicating, and the number of libraries pulled in could be significant, but we wouldn\u0027t be able to use any of the checking logic in FindLAPACK/BLAS (not without modifying it).\n\nIn our FindPackage scripts, e.g. FindEigen, if we can\u0027t find something, we make the variable visible in the GUI and emit an error message telling them what to do (I made this even more explicit in the latest patch).\n\nThoughts?",
