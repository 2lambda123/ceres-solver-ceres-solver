      "message": "I\u0027ve made a change to check for sign of value returned by cudssDataGet with CUDSS_DATA_INFO and it seems to be working as Kirill described in our email thread, although for for some reason (i guess cudssDataGet does not reset previously returned error) it required to (re)init cudss context (cudssData_t) at each analyze call, because when i reused the same cudssData_t to analyze/factorize problem with rescaled diagonal after unsuccessful attempt to analyze/factorize original problem, cudssDataGet returned the same error value.\n\nAlso, value returned in size_written argument of cudssDataGet with CUDSS_DATA_INFO still seems to be some garbage (it does not match the sizeof(int)), so i left this check disabled until this would be fixed.",

      "message": "I have not found any API method specific to resetting such error state. The cost of creating said context is negligible (i\u0027ve measured it to be about 20us on my laptop) compared to the cost of additional analyze stage computation, which is required because results of analyze stage are getting lost during such context resetting.\n\nI believe that we have two options here:\n\n1) Continue with currently implemented approach to reset such context and to pay additional analyze stage in case of factorization failure due to bad numerics. Obviously, such doubling of analyze cost is only relevant in \"try to factorize a matrix with bad numerics\" -\u003e \"rescale\" -\u003e \"try again\" scenario.\n\n2) Wait for new cuDSS release which either will add an explicit API call to reset a state associated with a value returned by cudssDataGet(CUDSS_DATA_INFO), or will change the logic behind cudssDataGet(CUDSS_DATA_INFO) to do such reset automatically.",
