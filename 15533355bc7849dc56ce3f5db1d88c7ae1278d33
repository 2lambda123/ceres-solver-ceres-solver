      "message": "As per C standard you\u0027re not allowed to mix variables declarations. GCC supports this as an extension of standard, but msvc is much more strict on this.\n\nMaybe newer msvc (i\u0027m using 20008pro -- version blender is officially guaranteed to work with) also supports mixed declarations and code, but that\u0027s what we\u0027re forbidding to do in Blender for better code compatibility -- you\u0027ll always have someone blaming on compilation error as soon as someone violates this standard. We also do have this as Werror flag for this, afair.",
