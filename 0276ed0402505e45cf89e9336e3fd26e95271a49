      "message": "Unfortunately we can\u0027t accept this as written, especially if it is a direct copy of NETLIB code. Any code in Ceres core must be licensable by us as BSD, and as written this appears to be a derived work.\n\nAt the moment we don\u0027t have a third_party/ directory where we could potentially put this. My preference is to write a specialized version we can safely license as BSD. Barring that we could start a third party directory, but it seems silly to do so for such a small method.\n\nFurthermore, this is unreadable code and not up to Ceres standards. It needs comments, style fixes, better variable names, cleaner structure, etc, so it is understandable.\n\nNit: We don\u0027t permit non-const reference parameters.",
