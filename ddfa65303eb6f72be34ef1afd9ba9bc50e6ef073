How should this appear in the release notes?\n\nThere are some FIXME\u0027s in the CL. The Windows, Android and iOS install instructions are most likely broken due to the removal of the Eigen / gflags find modules. I don\u0027t know what is the right fix.",

      "message": "One thing I noticed while working on the install doc was the very prominent note on an issue with SuiteSparse and building as a shared library \"up to at least Ubuntu 14.04\", and recommends installing suitesparse 4.2.1 from a PPA, which is also included in the \"install dependencies\" code block, that I suspect some people just copy\u0026paste without reading the surrounding text in all detail.\n\nSince 14.04 is EOL (at least for the public) and 16.04 seems to already have 4.4.6 (https://packages.ubuntu.com/xenial/libsuitesparse-dev), maybe all this should just be removed from the docs?",
