I never thought of doing something like this SFINAE approach to prevent mixing ints and jets.\n\nSince we had multiple Ceres users burned by the int/jet mixing problems, please add some no-compile tests to show that comparisons with ints don\u0027t work or don\u0027t behave badly.\n\nI wish I\u0027d recorded the details of the cases we ran into previously so I could paste them here, but it\u0027s been 10 years and the examples are lost to the mists of time.\n\nNit: Please capitalize the commit subject (first line).",
