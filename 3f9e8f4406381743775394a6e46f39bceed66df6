      "message": "This makes me think that we should rename the Quaternion manifold to QuaternionManifold, as it is not *a* quaternion, it\u0027s the definition of the manifold for (all) quaternions, and it would make this look more symmetric.  It\u0027s also likely to avoid name clashes with clients that would be nice",
