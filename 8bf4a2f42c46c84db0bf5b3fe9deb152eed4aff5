      "message": "I\u0027ve noticed that x86 build with mingw on windows has two tests failing (for example, in the following run: https://github.com/ceres-solver/ceres-solver/actions/runs/4034581971/jobs/6935906863#step:8:480 )\n\n`ParallelAssign` test fails due to mingw emitting x87 FPU instructions for scalar code, while using SSE instructions for vector code.\nThis leads to discrepancy between vectorized and non-vectorized code (due to different precision of intermediates).\n\nNote that another comment about bit-exactness (near `BlockSparseMatrixTest`, `RightMultiplyAndAccumulateParallelTest`) is not affected (since computations corresponding to a single row-block are the same).\n\nThe reason of `manifold_test` failing with a segfault is unclear.",
