      "message": "I incorrectly assumed that the scalar part is in the first coefficient not in the last one. Due to split terms, the denominator in the 2-argument `hypot` can therefore become zero. Since we deal with a unit quaternion, a more straightforward solution would be to exchange the nesting of expressions as follows:\n```\nhypot(hypot(q[0], q[1], q[2]), q[3])\n```\nUnless the scalar part is zero this should ensure an equivalent result.",
