      "message": "Hi Sergiu,\nhere is my second attempt at googletest. It half works. in the following sense,\nif there is no googletest installed on my mac then things work fine, but if there is a version installed then it fails with the following linking error.\n\n\nUndefined symbols for architecture arm64:\n  \"testing::internal::MakeAndRegisterTestInfo(char const*, char const*, char const*, char const*, testing::internal::CodeLocation, void const*, void (*)(), void (*)(), testing::internal::TestFactoryBase*)\", referenced from:\n      __GLOBAL__sub_I_array_utils_test.cc in array_utils_test.cc.o\n      __GLOBAL__sub_I_array_utils_test.cc in array_utils_test.cc.o\n      __GLOBAL__sub_I_array_utils_test.cc in array_utils_test.cc.o\n      __GLOBAL__sub_I_array_utils_test.cc in array_utils_test.cc.o\n      __GLOBAL__sub_I_array_utils_test.cc in array_utils_test.cc.o\nld: symbol(s) not found for architecture arm64\nclang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\nninja: build stopped: subcommand failed.\n\nI also tried pushing the include path for googletest manually to the front of the list of include paths, see line 420 of internal/ceres/CMakeLists.txt but that did not seem to help.\n\nI am at a bit of a loss as to what is going on, clearly the installed googletest is interfering, but I would think that demanding that the search path be to the installed version would do the trick.\n\nAny help would be appreciated.",
