      "message": "So it does need to be in \u003cbuild/config\u003e/ceres/internal because, of the next line:\n\nINCLUDE_DIRECTORIES(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/config)\n\nBecause we are building Ceres without copying config.h into the sources, it still needs to be in a ceres/internal dir, as it\u0027s #included with \"ceres/internal/config.h\".  I have added a better comment to clarify this - when it\u0027s installed obviously, it\u0027s put into the same location as all of the other headers.\n\nThe reason this was in internal was that it\u0027s only #included from port.h, which is in internal.  I see what you mean though, are you thinking of moving all headers from include/ceres/internal to include/ceres ?\n\nWe don\u0027t have to modify CeresConfig.cmake, as that works on an installed version of Ceres, in which case the configured config.h is in the same include/ceres/internal directory as port.h etc.",
