      "message": "It is not the first I see how compiler ignores `const` for functions declarations. You can see below that the definition has `const int` though declaration does not. Both `gcc` and `clang` behave strange in such cases.\n\nLittle offtop. Personally I like the idea of `const`ing everything even in functions arguments since several times it prevented for for accidentally assigning to passed argument because of type in an inner variable name.",
