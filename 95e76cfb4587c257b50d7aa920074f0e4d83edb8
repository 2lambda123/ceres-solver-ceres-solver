      "message": "That is a good point about not modifying code which comes from upstream. However, upstream did adopt this code for a strict compiler flags in b3d9be5c (which was done more than a year ago).\n\nTwo way i see here:\n\n- Update \"bundled\" gtest in Ceres, do it first, as a separate commit. This will bring us to all the latest changes/fixes, and will make this part pf this specific patchset obsolete.\n- Accept such a local modification of upstream file, it corresponds to happenings in upstream. And it\u0027s not like this file gets update that often.\n\nKinda prefer first, and can prepare patch for that.",
