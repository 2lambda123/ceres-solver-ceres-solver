      "message": "Updated the commit message with performance numbers.\n\nSome high-level questions + comments:\n- I just realized that the full report does not currently report when a mixed precision solver is used. How about adding a suffix after the \"Dense linear algebra library\" result? e.g.:\n  Dense linear algebra library             CUDA (FP64-FP32 Mixed Precision)\nI could add that in a revision to this patch.\n- The current ScopedTimers used in the solvers don\u0027t report cumulative times, they just log times per execution. Getting a cumulative time across all minimizer iterations as this patch does, is actually quite difficult without the patch.\n- I think there is value in reporting the cumulative breakdown times of the linear solver, since it reveals a clearer picture of how much of a potential benefit changing underlying linear algebra libraries makes, and that will affect production decisions like to run with / without GPUs, with what CPUs, with what libraries, etc. For example, it shows that for a large problem like problem-744-543562-pre.txt, providing more CPU cores for the Schur elimination has a greater performance impact than adding a GPU based solver.\n",
